# WildEye: AI-Powered Wildlife Detection and Monitoring

# Overview

WildEye is a deep learning-powered solution designed to assist wildlife conservation efforts by detecting, identifying, and tracking animals in their natural habitats. Leveraging the Snapshot Serengeti dataset, the project uses advanced object detection models to monitor species, analyze population trends, and generate actionable insights for conservationists. The system provides real-time animal detection, species-specific tracking, and interactive dashboards to visualize biodiversity and activity patterns.

# Key Features

Real-time Animal Detection: Detect and classify animals using advanced object detection models.

Species Identification: Monitor specific species and analyze population trends.

Interactive Dashboard: Visualize detection results, activity heatmaps, and population analytics.

Conservation-Focused: Provides actionable insights to aid wildlife conservation efforts.

# Dataset

Name: Snapshot Serengeti

Source: Snapshot Serengeti Dataset

Details: Includes over 3.2 million images of 40+ animal species captured in their natural habitat. Contains annotations for species, timestamps, and other metadata.

# Requirements

Install dependencies with:

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Getting Started

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/wildlife-detection.git
cd wildlife-detection

Download the Snapshot Serengeti dataset and place the images in data/images/.

Run preprocessing scripts in src/preprocessing/ to filter and resize images.

Train the object detection model using scripts in src/training/.

Launch the dashboard to visualize results:

streamlit run dashboard/app.py
